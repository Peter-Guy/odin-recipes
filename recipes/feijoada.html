<h3>History</h3>
<p>Feijoada (english: <i>bean stew</i>) is a classic from Brazil 
    with a rather sad background. Feijoada started as a food for 
    the slaves, as that the ingredients are rather cheap and back 
    in the day they used the left overs of pork and beef recipes. 
    Mixed with beans and other ingredients it is a wonderfull, 
    filling and nutricious recipe for anyone who enjoys a warm meal.
